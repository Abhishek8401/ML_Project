Sensitive Information Detection System using NLP 
Overview
The Sensitive Information Detection System is designed to automatically detect and classify sensitive information in a dataset. This tool can be particularly useful for identifying and redacting sensitive data from large text corpora, such as personal identifiable information (PII), credit card numbers, addresses, and other forms of confidential content.

This project uses machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to build a system capable of detecting sensitive information patterns in unstructured data.

Features
Text Processing: Preprocessing and cleaning raw text data.
Pattern Matching: Using regex and machine learning models to detect common sensitive data patterns
Classification: Classifying text segments as sensitive or non-sensitive based on predefined labels.
Visualization: Tools for visualizing the detection process and performance metrics.
Scalability: Ability to process large datasets efficiently.
Project Structure
/notebooks: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for model training, evaluation, and testing.
/data: Folder where datasets (training and test data) are stored.
/src: Core source code for the data processing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
/models: Trained models and model evaluation metrics.
/reports: Evaluation reports, including confusion matrices and classification reports.
requirements.txt: Python dependencies required to run the project.
Installation
Clone this repository:
bash

Dependencies
Python 3.7+
Jupyter Notebook
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
regex
nltk
tensorflow/keras (if using neural network models)
Models Used
Random Forest Classifier: For classification of sensitive vs. non-sensitive data.
Neural Networks: Optional for more complex feature learning and classification tasks.
Regular Expressions (Regex): For pattern-based detection (e.g., email, phone numbers).
Performance Metrics
Accuracy: Measures the overall correctness of the model.
Precision: How many of the detected sensitive information instances are actually sensitive.
Recall: How many actual sensitive instances were correctly identified by the model.
F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Future Work
Integration with data anonymization tools for redacting detected sensitive information.
Enhancements in NLP models to handle context-based sensitivity detection.
Extending the system for multilingual data.
